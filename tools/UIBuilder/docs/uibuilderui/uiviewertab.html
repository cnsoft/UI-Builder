<p>
This is a Marmalade System x86 Emulator window docked into the builder and running an application for viewing UI files using the iwui code. The currently selected element is displayed in the viewer with a black and white scrolling box surrounding it. You can select other elements by clicking on them. If an element is selected you can deselect it by clicking on it. You can add or remove elements from the current selection by shift clicking on them. You can also drag a selection box to select multiple items. The list of selected items can be moved by dragging then, however if they are under a layout, the layout calculates their position. If an element is selected and the mouse cursor is over the element handles appear at the corners and on the sides of the selection box. You can use these handles to drag the position and size of the element, however if they are under a layout, the layout calculates their position and size, also if sizeToContent is set the size is calculated. If the position of size is calculated it is not possible to set this parameter using the viewer.<br>
